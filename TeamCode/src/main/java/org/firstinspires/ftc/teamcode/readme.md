This is where I will be putting all of my projects for the 2024-2025 FTC season Into The Deep

I am currently working on a few auto classes utilizing odometry and P controllers.
I am also working on several TeleOp projects with smooth motion and easy single-button-presses for drivers.

All projects are still under development and are untested and theoretical. 

The Odometry.java class is using a locate() method whose logic is completely INCORRECT. Do not attempt to use
A new locate() method is being developed in the TestingOdometry.java class, where I develop new methods
for programs I intend to actually use.

There will be a short description in each class about its purpose, and all classes are commented for easy
reading.

Information on how to get started with programming in general and in Android Studio specifically can be
found in the sdkreadme.md
